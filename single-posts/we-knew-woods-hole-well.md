He took tiny steps on moist planks of the old pier. While he was walking towards the end, the quiet and gray town watched its inhabitant underneath a modest fog with its usual indifference. Planks are just about one foot wide. In these situations, it is clearly forbidden to have one foot put on two planks. People who look may have taken him seriously. But he was a squirrel stuck in a human body.

It was neither warm nor cold that day. He took his hands outside of his pockets&#8230; Then put them right back in. _Yes, the random moves of those who don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing_. He was pretty good at finding boring names to behavioral patterns that are not easy -or necessary- to explain. _Would you prefer to focus on things that are easy -and necessary- to explain, sire?_ No answer. The minutes he stood in front of the mirror a night before when he went into the bathroom to brush his teeth, for instance. Why do we find ourselves standing at unexpected places like that? No answer to this one, either. _Questions change, but your inability to answer is quite reproducible, sire_. At least I&#8217;m stable. He wasn&#8217;t. But he would have liked to be known as such. &#8220;_The deceased was quite stable_&#8220;, said the priest, kindly. Not everyone needed to know the truth in everything after all. The conglomeration spoke out like a kid who needed attention: &#8220;_Dear priest, we knew the deceased very well!_&#8220;. Yeah. &#8220;_And he knew us very well, too :) Burak, Salim, and others had tortured him quite a lot at the time, but he had never made a big deal out of it :)_&#8220;. Salim murmured something angrily. The camera panned to other faces in the conglomeration. All of them are beautiful people. They hadn&#8217;t really known the deceased that well. But they showed up when they heard. &#8220;_We couldn&#8217;t do it when he was alive, but here we are, the deceased, we are here for you :)_&#8220;.

&#8220;_They &#8216;knew&#8217; the deceased &#8216;well&#8217;_&#8220;, said the priest to herself. She filled her lungs as if she was going to say something in protest, but then changed her mind. The community was not ready for certain things. _So many of us died waiting for these people to be finally ready for certain things, isn&#8217;t it enough already!?_ It was true. Many people had died on this planet. Most of them had passed away while they were waiting for others, too. You could ask the priest: she had buried most of them. But her hands were bound. In fact it was only the deceased who had his both arms on both sides in the entire village: there was such a sweet comfort in being a deceased. He finally reached to the end of the pier. Click.

He looked at the boats floating on the calm water, which were left behind by the summer people. His gaze skipped towards the empty houses behind them. Empty houses, empty boats. _What are you doing in this empty village, kiddo?_ What? :) In Woods Hole it was not acceptable to respond to questions with questions. _So?_ Sassy, sticky questions that don&#8217;t go away without an answer. He attempted to respond. He couldn&#8217;t. We can&#8217;t even find answers to our own questions. Yet another win for questions. Questions: 1, answers: 0. See, winning was within the realm of possibilities after all. <em style="line-height: 1.5em;">We couldn&#8217;t even do as well as the questions we ask, sire</em>. If we are going to talk about the things we haven&#8217;t been able to do well, there are more striking examples to begin with, but the time that was allocated for us in Woods Hole has come to an end. _What? Is this really all they allocated for us?_ A couple of people in the conglomeration looked at their watches (&#8220;_well, it is a pretty good amount of time they were given in fact_&#8220;, one of them thought to himself).

The priest took a piece of paper out of her pocket. It was written by the deceased and was folded into four. She started reading it loudly with her strong and vibrant voice. &#8220;_This is my letter to the members of the conglomeration who happened to witness my journey. If the conditions permit, please read it to them right before I&#8217;m __buried_&#8220;. Many people in the conglomeration were nodding in excitement. The conditions are perfect! Please continue reading! And the priest continued. &#8220;_I don&#8217;t know where to start&#8221;._ A bunch of happy chuckles from the conglomeration flew away and got mixed into the festivus air, which was about to turn quite sour: &#8220;_It took too long for me to understand that everything was a matter of timing. It wasn&#8217;t that complicated at all: the ones who were early wasn&#8217;t desired, and there was no place left for those who were late. Maybe because I couldn&#8217;t see this, I haven&#8217;t been able to seal off those scrapbooks with people that I started during the last years of my life here. And here I was. But I wish my demise in Woods Hole to be a new start for all of us. I send my love to all of you, and seek shelter in your forgiveness_&#8220;.

The faces with frozen smiles were looking around with surprise and disappointment. Following a moment of quiescence, &#8220;_isn&#8217;t the deceased being a bit rude, miss priest!?_&#8220;, said one of the deceased old friends to express her discomfort. &#8220;_Yeah!_<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&#8220;, said the other one, in agreement. &#8220;<em>Where is hope, where is courage?!</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&#8220;, asked yet another one. The priest invited everyone to silence, but it was not going to be possible to facilitate the peace. &#8220;<em>Someone from the conglomeration shall go up there and fix this! We want our right to respond!</em>&#8220;.</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> The happy atmosphere was now replaced with an intense one that was thicker than the fog: what the fuck was that supposed to mean to die from ineptitude, and upsetting the ones who are left behind&#8230; OK, OK, said the priest. Pick someone, and I shall let them &#8216;respond&#8217; to the deceased.</span></span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">After a short break the chosen one took the stage with his black suit, and his running shoes. He was known to be very close to the deceased.  The priest put off her cigarette and wrapped herself back into her toga. The spokesperson of the conglomeration gently touched his glasses that were about to slide down from his aged nose. Dear members of the conglomeration, respected priest, valuable citizens of Woods Hole, and of course our beloved friend, lover, brother, son, cousin, or the one who we simply met online: the deceased, who, with his unexpected and quiet departure, gave us a reason to get together on this beautiful day here in Woods Hole. We have to be frank with you: your letter disappointed us deeply (some members of the conglomeration was almost going to applaud this foreword, yet they decided to save their energy for later). The series of events which gave you the reasons to end your seclusion in Woods Hole by passing away are opaque to us, yet the conglomeration do not accept your failure, and chooses to continue remembering you as a strong and powerful member of it. A thunderstorm of an applaud tore the sky. The conglomeration started to feel better again. The priest raised her both arms to invite everyone back to silence. The old man subtly nodded to thank her, and continued. We went through hard times, too. But we worked and worked, and learned to deal with them. We closed all the unfinished scrapbooks with people one by one, didn&#8217;t linger in the past, and continued with our story. We didn&#8217;t wake up every night and asked ourselves &#8220;<em>why</em>&#8220;. We didn&#8217;t let those cliches we laughed at when we were young to become the keys that fit every lock in our lives. If you hadn&#8217;t become the deceased, we would have taught you the secrets of life, too. But what did you do? You prisoned yourself in Woods Hole. Run away. Side roads did not turn into your way, you turned into side roads. Before sealing off the ones that are open, you started new chapters with new ones</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">. So aren&#8217;t we going to open a new one when someone rings the door bell? Maybe we will! But first we will put on the safety chain, then we will look through the gap, and then reluctantly ask &#8220;<em>yes, who are you looking for?</em>&#8220;. That&#8217;s how we will send them away, and continue with our lives.</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> The door bell rang. He put the safety chain, and opened the door unwillingly. A young lady. Could have been his daughter. Her loving gaze did not waste any time and went through his blue pajamas, white shirt, running shoes, and his beard that was carelessly painted with ancient shades of silver and white. Yes, who are you looking for? You! I&#8217;ve been looking for you :) You are very sweet, but this is the wrong address. He was about to close the door. But no, no, she said, here is the address :) The girl was holding a yellow post-it, the sticky part of which was filled with years worth of dust and hair. Members of the conglomeration looked at each other nervously. The guy took the paper. Fixed his glasses back into their place, where they clearly didn&#8217;t want to stay. Something something street, something something floor, somewhere somewhere, said the post-it. When he recognized the handwriting on the paper, the poor guy&#8217;s face fell like a Spanish soldier in the civil war. My dear, the address is right but the time is not. But how is that possible, I grew up with your stories :) He reached to his restless glasses and took them off. While she was trying to look into the house, he took a step to the right anxiously behind the door. As a matter of fact, the insides of my house is all over the place, everything in here is quite torn. He really needed to sit now. Maybe you should come another time. Of course, how about tomorrow? I can help with the cleaning too? :) Come some other time. For instance a time where things did not come to this point. A very different time, is what I mean. His breath started to faint. The girl was sad and disappointed now, and her heart too was a bit torn, yet she hid all of them behind her smile. It wasn&#8217;t her fault. She was stuck on a page of history that was written before her time. While she was turning back, the guy slowly closed the door. He put himself on the old seat covered with green velvet. A cloud of dust evacuated their home, and landed on a bunch of scrapbooks lying on the floor.</span></span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The conglomeration and the priest carried the man, and buried him next to the deceased. Both of them shared a modest epitaph, which said,</span>

> ___The deceased, and the deceased. 1822 &#8211; 1453 &#8211; 2005 &#8211; 2015. Some years are claimed by the savannah: yellow, orange, and sedentary. Some are stuck in valleys where rivers flow intensely. They went around and around, and shared experiences that were common to this universe, and beyond.___

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">While the conglomeration was dispersing, one of them who was neither Burak nor Salim approached to the priest, and took the letter of the deceased.</span>

Dear diary, I decided to leave Woods Hole short after I took the photograph above. And a short while after that I accepted an offer, which was going to take me to Chicago.

Before I left for Chicago, I was putting together my office, where I spent most of my days in my 4 years stay in Woods Hole:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3261" alt="france-1" src="http://meren.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/france-1.jpg" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://meren.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/france-1.jpg 1200w, https://meren.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/france-1-900x506.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" />
</p>

I had written this that day:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m gathering my things in this office. After dedicating yet another four years of it to this village. I am about to take my life that would fit into the back seat of a car, and leave for another place. This is playing in the background: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9kGpx88MoE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9kGpx88MoE</a>. A tiny life in a tiny box in a tiny office. You know how you would look at the size of a well-compressed file and go like, &#8220;wow, there wasn&#8217;t any entropy in this one!&#8221;. I feel like that file. He was 35 years old. He hesitated as if he remembered something and looked around. If he had looked a bit more maybe he was going to better understand something. But &#8216;whatever&#8217;, he said, &#8216;next time&#8217;, and continued</em>&#8220;.
</p>

And my life _did_ fit into the back seat of my car, by the way:

<p style="text-align: center;">

Thanks to your occasional e-mails, this blog has always been somewhere in my mind. In fact I even prepared a mixed tape (hehe) for you while I was driving to Chicago, but I just couldn&#8217;t put it online until now. Here I am today, and here is your mixed tape:
