Approximately two weeks ago, I went to see Anoush in Yellowstone. It&#8217;s been a very long time since I&#8217;ve been dreaming about this trip. However, I had no idea that the perfect mix of two well-known phenomena was going to make this two weeks the longest two weeks I&#8217;ve ever lived: (1) every journey presents its disappointments and surprises, (2) the longer you dream about something, the longer time you give the universe to set up the engine of improbabilities.

That very long wait have consumed me.

I spent the first week in Yellowstone with a disease that appeared from nowhere, and the second week was spent with heart breaks. No one was responsible for the first half, however, even though I am still in the progress of figuring out how I managed to get things to this point, I take the responsibility for the second half. How long is two weeks? _That would vary from person to person, from week to week, dude_. Absolutely true. Too many things were scattered into this two weeks which is about to come to an end in a couple of hours. Scales got mixed.

This introduction shows that I am a little bit lost. Yes. I got lost. When I got lost, people around me got lost as well. If you keep reading I may lose you, too. As a person who spent more than 3 decades on this planet, I am not sure whether I should feel proud for being able to get lost or feel embarrassed. But I can write. So I am writing. And if you are going to read, read it without being effusive. _You are too uptight Meren, let it go, let it go_. True. If I could let it go I would have been in a much better place.

I feel like I am writing the last entry of this blog. If that becomes to be the case, let it be.

I&#8217;ve been extremely busy before I took off for Yellowstone. Aside the routine busyness, I was going to give a lecture about the method I&#8217;ve been working on. People who took my classes before would confirm that I am a terrible teacher. So I had to try very hard to get prepared. Meanwhile my fever was going up and down through this 3 weeks period, but I wasn&#8217;t paying much attention. So I already was in a mild sickness even before I was in Yellowstone. _Dude, why didn&#8217;t you go to a doct.._ I hope I didn&#8217;t give you the impression that I am capable of doing the smart and obvious things. _OK, OK. Whatever_.

Due to dehydration and climbing up to 2,500 meters from the sea level, the mild sickness I was suffering from became a serious problem. The more severe it developed, the more unaware I became about my surroundings. I started looking at my Anoush, the person I missed very very much, and her life in Yellowstone through a tulle curtain.

Anoush took me to a clinic in Yellowstone. Even though the doctor there did not diagnose me with anything particular, he concluded that dehydration took part in my sickness and sent me back with this suggestion: &#8220;_Drink a lot, rest a lot_&#8220;. Because I am such an obedient person, I drank a lot of water, and I was going to rest, too. I read a lot about dehydration while I was in the bed. Actually when I felt a little better, I even wrote a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151053932628863&set=a.75131918862.76432.539633862&type=1) about what dehydration can do to someone. If you think one or more of these symptoms are an integral part of your daily life, you may find it beneficial to read that post:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; Negative / depressed mood</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Fatigue</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Getting angry too quick</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Headache</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Sleepiness</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Reluctance for physical activity</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Dizziness, especially when you stand up</em>
</p>

This photograph is attached to the note. It is one of the first photographs I took in the park (and at that particular moment I had no idea that it was going to be one of the last ones I was going to be able to take for a while):

</p>

While people were kindly sending their &#8220;get well soon&#8221; wishes under that Facebook post, I was quietly getting very very bad during the night of the day I wrote the post. It was becoming obvious that my symptoms could not be explained only by dehydration. While this was happening, Anoush and I were at one of the most remote locations in the continental US.

Terrible hallucinations I was experiencing that night due to high fever rendered that night to be the longest night I&#8217;ve ever had in my life. Moreover, this experience took place with a terrible pattern: I am in bed, hallucinating, once in a while I instinctively come to a sitting position in bed. All of a sudden I regain consciousness and realize that I&#8217;ve been hallucinating. However, my blood pressure is so low that I faint back to my bed and start hallucinating something else. Have you seen Memento? Same deal. After a while, every time I was coming to a sitting position I was begging &#8220;_please, I will go back into the hallucinations, I should remember this, I can stop this_&#8221; right before I fall again.

By the way, it is me who was doing this to myself: My brain, my immune system. I&#8217;d like to speak to the people who I accidentally broke their hearts, or hurt them one way or another: I think I got your revenge from myself, I think we can be friends again.

Next day Anoush takes me to a hospital in Jackson Hole, WY, the closest city. We go to ER. While we were driving to the hospital we were thinking that it wouldn&#8217;t take more than 1 or 2 hours in the hospital. However when my symptoms get ER doctors confused, they tell us that I should stay in the hospital that night. I found myself in relief, nervousness, and needles:

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  ***
</p>

When I was being located in a hospital room for the night, Anoush was going to a hotel next to the hospital in sadness.

<table width="100%" border="0">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

02:30 a.m. The first thing I feel when I open my eyes in the dimly lit room is the pain on my arm. It must be the result of nurse digging my flesh with needles to find my thin vein. Suddenly I realize that there is someone watching me in the room. A gray haired, good looking guy around his 60&#8217;s is looking at me over his glasses which magically stays at the tip of his nose, almost defying gravity. His hands are in his pockets and he seems to be concerned.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; Hi.</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Hi.</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Meren, right?</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Yes.</em><br /> <em> &#8211; I read your file. But I want you to tell me everything once again.</em>
</p>

I tell him everything once again. I had mild fever for three weeks. I was hallucinating like that, my head hurt like this, my left ear also hurts, there is pain at the right side of my tonsils, et cetera. While he is listening to me quietly, he examines me from my toes to my hairline. I am completely surrendered. He looks at my blood work. Checks my ears again. Listens to my lungs. Finally he takes his glasses off and sits next to my bed: &#8220;_it is obvious that you have a problem, Meren, but I don&#8217;t know what it is_&#8220;. Well. That is what I deserve.

There is not much in the blood cultures that indicate this is a bacterial infection. However after a couple of hours he tells me that the differential diagnosis rules everything else out and I am going to be put on a heavy antibiotics treatment. I&#8217;m OK with that. Next day, with the antibiotics, my white blood cell counts start to go back to normal and my fever decreases. At some point I feel that everything looks clearer. As if someone is finally lifting the tulle curtain.

But almost immediately after I start to feel better, a wild headache appears, and is being followed by an excruciating abdominal pain. There is no way I can explain this pain. Nurses, even though they have no idea about the source of this pain, give me hydromorphone for relief. I later learn that Anoush leaves the hospital in tears, thinking of the worst. Meanwhile with all those drugs, I feel like a soldier who was just saved from a prison, in which he has been tortured for years, and looking from the window of the helicopter to this awful place (I mean I am literally flying). And the shutters close down, slowly.

When I wake up the next day I can walk fine. I go all the way to the end of the corridor and try to see some wild life.

I feel great in the afternoon. I am being discharged from the hospital.

Anoush is always with me. Anoush is always with me.

It is quiet in the car on the way back. I can&#8217;t remember its color. Maybe it&#8217;s because of the tiredness. Maybe it is because of the astonishment. It&#8217;s been one week since I came to Yellowstone, but it is as if I am looking at my girlfriend for the first time. Grand Tetons in the horizon. I remember these moments very vaguely now.

We took a wrong turn on the road. Half knowingly. At some point we rest next to the Jenny Lake at the foot of the Tetons. Quietness persists.

I immediately remember why I love Yellowstone so much when we are back in the park. Everywhere I look, I see scenes as if painted by a painter.

Maybe a little before the photograph above, maybe a little after that we have a dialog that starts with something like this:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; Life is such an amazing thing.</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Right? I repeat the same thing every day I spent in Yellowstone.</em>
</p>

Yellowstone is truly amazing. But I am thinking about the bacteria at that moment.

While the active ingredient in the antibiotic I take kills millions, maybe billions of bacteria that had taken over my body, life seems to experience a major defeat. _In order to make one Meren live, we didn&#8217;t refrain ourselves from killing billions_. On the other hand while everything that makes those bacteria is being decomposed by their smaller components, what is actually happening is analogous to breaking a toy that is made up from Lego pieces. Those little pieces do not lose any of their capacity to be a part of another form of life. Maybe parts of those dying bacteria will be a part of my own cells, or maybe other bacteria that live on my body, or something else. But they certainly will become something new.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>Don&#8217;t worry my little bacterium,</em><br /> <em> You are just going to decompose.</em><br /> <em> Then you are going to be parts of other forms of life.</em><br /> <em> Maybe one of those forms will be a flower.</em><br /> <em>Maybe a bee will land on that flower one day,</em><br /> <em> And maybe,</em><br /> <em> Maybe some of that bee will be you, as well.</em>
</p>

Universe does not care about our stories. While the hammer of entropy swings at every direction in order to decompose everything into their smallest components, us giving too much importance to the toys must be the result of the process of natural selection. Otherwise our mediocrity is obvious in my opinion (which is a very nice thing). But thanks to the natural selection, the wisest of us must have got extinct long time ago.

Words of Dr. Manhattan, the character in Watchmen gets somewhat close to what I feel:

> A live body and a dead one contain the same number of particles. Structurally there&#8217;s no discernible difference.

The amount of interest the Lego company would have towards a toy made by a kid with legos should be similar to the amount of interest the universe would have towards the lives that is built on complex elements, such as Oxygen, Phosphor, Nitrogen and Carbon, that were offered by the stars. It breaks my heart a little (because I am going to die), but it gives me relief more than it breaks my heart (because the divine justice you are looking for is right here).

Yes. The life is an amazing thing. Because you are an extension of it, you are amazing, too. But maybe you shouldn&#8217;t exaggerate, and should find a way to get over yourself. _Maybe you should start doing that yourself._ So true.

One of the things we did with Anoush once I was out of the hospital was going to the Grand Prismatic. The third largest hot spring in the world. Because I&#8217;ve been working with bacteria, and the memories of what bacteria did to me was so fresh, I was overwhelmed with emotions and thoughts while I looked at it from a distance.

<table width="100%" border="0">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

50 meters deep, discharging 2,000 liters water at 70C degrees every minute, this hot spring is like a nightmare for life. As you can see, even the trees that are present in everywhere in the park are looking at it from a safe distance. It is very hard for them to deal with the mineral-rich waters of this hot spring. However, the life, understanding that there is nothing it could do with its main forces, is not planning to give up: it uses its smallest soldiers and puts up an amazing guerrilla fight to conquer Grand Prismatic. Water that is coming from the dark and quiet places of the Earth&#8217;s crust is being greeted by chanting soldiers of life: Yellows, oranges, greens, reds and browns you see in the photograph above is the result of the existence of diverse and rich bacteria. Even at high temperatures towards the middle of the hot spring, where even bacteria can&#8217;t survive, thermophilic archaea is doing its best. A colorful carpet that is composed of little ambassadors of life is being put underneath the feet of sterile water: a greeting that is completely fait accompli. _Hi. Your journey in Earth&#8217;s dark corridors has been ended. We were sent here to introduce you to the eccentricities of life. The green stuff you can see on your right hand side are called trees. On your left, you can see the most lonely mammals on the planet who think they know everything walking around and looking at us. Cheers!_

The same day I had an opportunity to get as close as I want to the thermal features in an area that was clear of tourists. While I was taking pictures of a geyser, Anoush and her friends were <a href="http://meren.org/wp-content/gallery/yellowstone-2012/yst-11.jpg" target="_blank">having fun</a> in the river down below, where the <a href="http://meren.org/wp-content/gallery/yellowstone-2012/yst-13-1.jpg" target="_blank">hot discharge</a> of this geyser was creating a pleasant warmth.

I love people. But I don&#8217;t have a clear answer to why I was spending all my time up above in the thermal area instead of enjoying the water with them.

This is how I lose. Then even the surprises I find cannot save me:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; Hey guys look what I found: &#8220;Yellowstone loves you&#8221; :) I love you too :))</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Sure. You arrogant judgmental asocial son of a bitch. Why don&#8217;t you you go and play with thermal features a little longer.</em><br /> <em> &#8211; But :(</em>
</p>

I can&#8217;t be resentful to anyone who may perceive me this way. I deserve it.

I sometimes live life with a kid&#8217;s amazement whose monologue to his father is being cut with a swift slap after not realizing the fact that his father was getting angry about something while he was speaking to him excitedly. That day we broke each others hearts with Anoush over nothing. I broke hers more than she breaks mine. _Fuck you Meren, you deserve nothing_. Maybe. Long story short, that night is sad. I go by myself to take a photograph of Yellowstone Lake. Stars here and there. Night is cold. Lake is cold. Everything is cold.

The next day there is a hike that was planned before. Anoush, I and another group of friends are going to Heart Lake. After all those days I spent in the hospital, I am excited to have a hike for 25 kilometers on a trail that goes up and down. First serious break is at 6th kilometer. I still feel a little bit alone, a little bit broken.

After a while Heart Lake is in the horizon (it has nothing to do with the popular shape of the heart):

Next to it, there is Mt. Sheridan. The first group that was discovering the park towards the end of 1800&#8217;s names the mountain as _Brown Mountain_. A couple of years later, another group names the mountain as _Yellow Mountain_. And then the name becomes _Red Mountain_ by another group. Finally someone gives Sheridan as a name, to honor Phillip H. Sheridan, an army general who loved the park deeply. In my heart its name is _BrownyellowredmountainthatIcouldntclimb_.

<p style="text-align: center;">

When we arrive at the camping spot I put up the tent and walk towards the thermal features I had seen from a distance while we were walking. I find an amazing hot spring on the way.

Right after this photograph I want to sit in front of it in order to think about the last two days and try to understand what those sad and lonesome thoughts actually want. But when I was about to start negotiations, ground starts shaking with a scary noise. Adrenaline, like the the police attacking peaceful demonstrators, disperses sad thoughts from the streets of my mind hastily. Not being able to express themselves, sad thoughts are fleeing into dark alleys to avoid a conflict with the forces of adrenaline, breaking windows with disappointment and frustration on the way. A bunch of old, forgotten memories who live in those dark alleys are disappointed with the vandalism.

Meanwhile I still am trying to understand what is happening in my physical world. Then I realize that there is geyser on my left, and the noise is coming from its burst. Going around it carefully, I reach to the other side of it. It first amazes me with its colors:

<table width="100%" border="0">

  </tr>
</table>

A couple of minutes later, without giving any sort of notice it <a href="http://meren.org/wp-content/gallery/yellowstone-2012/yst-21.jpg" target="_blank">bursts</a> again by creating a tiny earth quake and an awful noise. I startle again with amazement.

Bacteria welcomes the sterile water molecules and introduce them to the eccentrics of life. _Welcome! The green stuff you can see on your right hand side are called trees. On your left, you can see one of the most lonely mammals on the planet who think he knows everything looking at us. Cheers!_ Fucking life, and its fucking committee.

What happens between the night we came from Heart Lake and the next morning is still a mystery to me. I probably will never find an answer to the question &#8216;why?&#8217;. But I take my backpacks and I am on my way back to home the next morning. Confused. Eccentrics of life.

It is Wednesday. My goal is to get to Bozeman and start waiting for my plane, which actually will leave on Saturday. Bozeman is 142 kilometers from where I am. No public transportation. I will either walk, or hitchhike.

When I hitchhike to 62 cars and none of them stop, I take out 10 dollars from my pocket to communicate that I am willing to help with the gas. But at this point my attractiveness is 0 absolute: I look terrible after walking under the sun with my two backpacks. Burnt skin, no water. I am a mess. Moreover, I don&#8217;t think my hair that I shaved a day ago impulsively contributes to my quest positively. I can&#8217;t blame people who does not stop. _We loved you with your long hair Meren_. Well, I guess I had loved myself like that, too. Please lets don&#8217;t talk about it.

<table width="100%" border="0">

    <td align="center">
      <img alt="" src="http://meren.org/wp-content/gallery/yellowstone-2012/yst-26.jpg" border="0" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

At this point I am someone who made one of the hardest, one of the most impulsive, one of the most unstable, one of the most unbacked decisions of his life only hours ago. I live in dilemmas. I almost want to make faces to cars so they wouldn&#8217;t stop and I would stuck in the park. On the other hand staying feels harder than leaving; if I could do it I would just beam myself to a random planet in Alpha Centauri (let alone going to Bozeman, which is 130 kilometers away, I would take a hitchhike to 4.2 million light years away).

While I live in these quandaries, people are very consistent: they don&#8217;t take me. People are not like me. _We are not like him_. As someone who never not stopped for a hitchhiker before, I have to admit that I am extremely disappointed with people at this point.

That day while I was hitchhiking for hours without any luck I realized that I never felt this far, this disconnected from other human beings, I realized that there was no single day in my life history that I felt as alone as I felt that day. But I am not resentful to anyone except the people in that white jeep who stopped 50 meters away and made me run with my bags only to take off when I had 10 meters left.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

Finally I decide to find a cardboard and put it on my backpack after writing where I was going. I didn&#8217;t have any energy left to raise my arm. No more hitchhiking. I don&#8217;t know how long I&#8217;ve been walking, but a black Mustang which had passed me 5 minutes ago stops next to me after 2 U-turns and lowers its tinted passenger window. There is a guy with sunglasses in the car. When I look through the passenger window, he shows me his mediocre Canon camera and asks:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; Do you know how to use this?</em><br /> <em> &#8211; (nervously) Well, yes, I do, I actually like photog</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Jump in.</em><br /> <em> &#8211; So are you going to Bozem</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Jump in!</em><br /> <em> &#8211; :&#8217;)</em>
</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The person who takes me in his car is Gary.

When I&#8217;m in his car I learn that he recently bought the camera and is interested me to teach a couple of tricks about it. I try to teach him a couple of tricks on the way. But then he is not interested. He is more interested to know about my life and what I was doing in the middle of nowhere.

We exchange stories. I don&#8217;t have much to say about my life, but Gary is such a character. He is 70 years old. He tells me that he had many women, but never married. No kids. No family. He comes to Yellowstone 5 years ago for the first time and falls in love with the park. Sells everything he has in California, quits the job he&#8217;s been working for 28 years and moves to Bozeman: a city where he knows absolutely no one. During the last 5 years he drives his car at least 4 times to Yellowstone around 3-4 in the morning, regardless of the season, just to see the sun rise in the park, and goes back to Bozeman around noon (so he drives approximately 1,000 kilometers every week).

Because he is old now he doesn&#8217;t hike or camp. He just watches the park from within his car. He is from North Carolina where his father had a ranch in a small small town. His mom had never left their ranch as far as he can remember. His father, on the other hand, never left the town. It baffles him as a kid. Not wanting to be someone like his parents, he leaves home when he is 15 and starts working at the other side of the US (I believe it is the motivation of &#8216;not wanting to become our parents&#8217; what really shapes our life to a point). Unlike his stationary parents, he spends his life going to everywhere in the US. He is a republican on fire. Extremely serious about it. He likes Bush, Palin, Romney, doesn&#8217;t _believe_ in global warming, the theory of evolution. But at some point he tells me this:

> I didn&#8217;t travel the world, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that don&#8217;t know how lucky I am to be born in the US. I know there are people in other countries who suffer. Every time I come to Yellowstone, I think about the people who doesn&#8217;t have the chance to enjoy this beauty, instead they have to struggle for their lives. I feel terrible. I feel ashamed of my ignorance. I feel ashamed of my richness. I feel ashamed of myself. Because there is nothing I can do.

I want to say something in return, something smart and wise, but I don&#8217;t have anything to say. If you would ask me a day before I probably would have said &#8220;_I don&#8217;t think there would be any common ground for me to be on the same page with an extreme republican_&#8220;. Yet there I am, amazed by this guy, and feel like we can be friends. Every journey makes me embarrassed for one of my prejudgements. Maybe it is time for me to change.

On the way he tells me how happy he is for taking me and how glad he is that we met. Vice versa, Gary. When we arrive at Bozeman I try to give him $40 for gas. He tells me to get out of his car. I take the photo above. Black mustang roars away.

I start walking on the streets of Bozeman aimlessly like a horse thief. As a result of walking too much with heavy backpacks my right knee starts making this weird noise at every step I take. My mind is filled with Anoush. I have no idea what else is there. _Maybe bacteria?_. Maybe. When I see young people showing me each other and laughing at me from the other side of the street I realize that it is time for me to get rid of my cardboard. I put it in a recycling box on the side:

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Every meaning in my life starts to fade away while I am walking aimlessly. At some point even the act of walking loses its meaning. With that, I collapse on the grass on one of the streets of Bozeman. I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing. Not only for that particular moment, I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing in a very general sense either. I know that I reach to the global minimum: the best place to be to restart. Duygu calls me out of the blue. She finds me a motel address over the Internet. I am determined to go there. Life regains meaning only enough to start walking again. I start walking towards the address. It turns out that it is almost exactly where Gary left me in Bozeman.

When I&#8217;m in the motel I sent an e-mail to Clara (who I met 2 years ago when I first came to Bozeman with Mike to visit a lab) to ask her if she would like to have a coffee with me. During our e-mail exchange she learns that I&#8217;m in a motel in Bozeman and tells me that _she would never leave me in a motel_. I am very obedient. Clara and her husband Seth arrive with their 35 years old blue jeep and pick me up the next morning from the motel. I tell them my story briefly on the way.

Following two days both Clara and Seth invent ways to keep my mind busy in a very discreet way. One night we go to a dinner party of a Turkish scientist who put leashes on bacteria with nano-ropes at Montana State University (we end up talking about bacteria all night), another night we take a midnight-hike on a mountain during the moon light, and then we visit their friends&#8217; ranches, and then we run errands together, etc. (I know that the first time I&#8217;ll be alone with myself and my thoughts is going to be in Bozeman Airport; I am not really looking forward to it). I am assigned here during the times that are not spent with activity, and this is exactly where I am writing this blog post from:

I heard from people that Bozeman had been experiencing a major drought. When I&#8217;m writing these, rain is falling on the mountains of Bozeman.

Trying to imagine how many of these rain drops would contain at least one water molecule that actually went through Grand Prismatic at least once, feels much more easier than to try to reason how and why what happened during the last week did actually happen. I want to blame my weird illness that took place during the first week for my chemical and psychological instability. Everything was either too slow, or too fast. &#8220;_An unforgettable 2 weeks_&#8220;, produced, directed and played by _time_. Happy is who can question &#8220;_why_&#8221; and feel satisfied with the answers they find. For the rest, there is Kurt Vonnegut:

> Here we are, trapped in the amber of the moment. There is no why.

And what we call &#8216;_we_&#8216; is an abstract that is defined in the compartments of time based on what we live episodically.

And there is no &#8216;why&#8217;.

There is no &#8216;why&#8217;.
