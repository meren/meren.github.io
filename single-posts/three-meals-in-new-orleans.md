I went to New Orleans last week for three days. All by myself. Without telling people here that I was going, without telling people there that I was coming. Reasons I had to go to New Orleans have changed in time. But if you&#8217;d have asked me &#8220;_why Meren? why New Orleans?_&#8221; in the airport, I would have told you that I am going there &#8220;_to have a breakfast at La Boulangerie, to have a lunch in Liuzza&#8217;s, and to drink Abita Amber_&#8220;.

I did go to New Orleans. I did have a breakfast at La Boulangerie. I did have a lunch at Liuzza&#8217;s. I did drink an Abita Amber at the night. Plus I met lovely people, and I thought, and thought.

As soon as I left the airplane in New Orleans I went to the Children&#8217;s Hospital to surpise my PhD adviser, Mike. After all those years I spent in the research wing of the hospital, people asked me to put that &#8216;visitor&#8217; tag (&#8216;mericans take thier jobs very seriously). I felt the unjust resentment of an old old guy who can only visit the house he spent his childhood as a visitor after it was converted into a museum. I really don&#8217;t know why do I feel all these stupid feelings.

I went to the second floor. When I walked into the corridor where all the office doors are next to each other like dominos, I saw Mike&#8217;s door open as usual. Because some things never change (actually they change so slow that we think they do not change, and then we miss the opportunity to understand the theory of evolution completely). When I walked into his room I found him reading a thick book in front of his book shelf.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; Dr. Ferris, according to the new rules of our hospital all doors must remain shut at all times.</em><br /> <em> &#8211; What? (after a little shock) M..Meren?</em><br /> <em> (laughters)</em>
</p>

It&#8217;s been a long time since I met someone who was surprised to see me. We spent too much time in the same places where people don&#8217;t find it surprising to see us. If no one is surprised to see you for a week, leave that life behind and find another one to live. Acutally I managed to surprise a lot of people in New Orleans with my presence and filled my quota for a year. May your turn come next.

We went to the lab with Mike to say hi to the rest of his people. When I walked into the lab I was shocked to see that my work place was preserved the way it was just like the bedroom of a young soldier who died in a war. Here, I had taken [this one](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150601205098863) more than 1,5 years ago (here is another [perspective]({{ site.url }}/images/three-meals-in-new-orleans-workspace.jpg)). Shame on you if I died in a war and you don&#8217;t tell me.

I learned that Mike had a talk in an institute called Pennington Biomedical which is an hour away from New Orleans. Turns out that he was going to talk about the bacteria that harbors the human body. &#8220;_These are the stuff you are working on, why don&#8217;t you come with me if you don&#8217;t have anyting important to do?_&#8220;. _If I didn&#8217;t have anything important to do_&#8230; I&#8217;m telling him that I came to NOLA to have a breakfast, he tells me to go with him if I don&#8217;t have anything important to do. Of course I did go. I talked about the role of bacteria in the development of ulcerative colitis and met an amazing gastroenterolog and listened to his speculations about the impact of the hosts genes on the structure of the microbial communities that harbor them.

The next day I went to the apartment where Duygu, Ahmet and I spent a couple of years. The building was almost the way I left it (here is the [evidence](http://meren.org/blog/2009/08/nikon-10-5mm-fisheye-lens/), I had taken the photograph at the end of that post 3 years ago).

I took the stairs and looked around. Meanwhile I&#8217;m not sure about my intentions. _What the hell am I looking for?_ Yeah. Is it a general question about life? Who knows. I always am very vague and alwaus ask very tough questions to myself whenever I&#8217;m left alone (maybe that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t like to be alone).

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; Who knows what the hell am I looking for.<br /> </em>&#8211; <i>Seriously, what are you looking for?</i><br /> <em>&#8211; What makes you think it is your business? Maybe I have nothing else to do?</em><br /> <em>&#8211; &#8220;Maybe I have nothing else to do&#8221;. Is this your excuse? Failure, Meren. That&#8217;s what you are.</em>
</p>

Uptight Meren had no tolerance to himself.

While I was looking around, I saw the following sight. A rotting pumpkin from the last Halloween, and a sculpture, head of which was was put back by someone with an unimpressive attempt. A synical act of the humankind&#8217;s journey in the last a couple of thousand years.

When I was walking back to the car, I saw that the piece I created while I was the New Orleans ambassador of &#8220;vandals who can&#8217;t resist to wet cement&#8221; school. It was still in exhibition. Since I managed to get all of yous attention right here on this line, I would like to confess that I did feel a primitive happiness and satisfaction from seeing this now embarrassing monument.

When the blanket of night was getting prepared to cover whatever was bound to happen that night in this sinful city, I was on my way to my favorite place to be in New Orleans: _Zot&#8217;z_. It is a coffee shop on Oak Street uptown where students come and study for hours and hours. This is a culture in the US. People go to coffee shops to study (I also witnessed heated conversations here, in which random people saved their country, or the entire planet (and sometimes even the universe)). People wouldn&#8217;t go study in coffee shops when I was back in Turkey. It was pretty interesting to observe this when I first came to the US.

  </tr>
</table>

I like Zot&#8217;z, but the actual reason for me to be there was not that. There was an e-mail I wanted to answer. A suprising dialouge that started only a couple of minutes before I started my trip to New Orleans turned into something that required me to read and write long long e-mails in various places in New Orleans. I would have liked to give more details for the people who read my blog frequently and know about [what happened in Yellowstone](http://meren.org/blog/two-weeks-of-fire-in-yellowstone/), but I know that I have to be calm and quiet for now. So I choose to be quiet and patient. But I can say this much: this is one of the most treacherous lessons of this life that we never get to learn (&#8220;_Life in two weeks for dummies, rule number 18_&#8220;):

> You are going to have things you&#8217;d die for proportionally to your ability to learn to stop wanting them.

Well. This shall be a small &#8216;moral of the story&#8217; for everyone, and we shall continue as if it didn&#8217;t happen.

I spent almost the entire next day for the act of eating. I was going to have a breakfast at La Boulangerie, a lunch at Liuzza&#8217;s and have an Abita Amber in the night.

First stop was La Boulangerie on Magazine Street.

Croissant, strawbery tart and coffee.

When I was relatively poor in New Orleans (I mean, when I was poorer than I am now), many times I wanted to thank everyone in this bakery for making such delicious things for such low prices. I never did that. But this time I was determined. I put all my social skills together (which aren&#8217;t much) and thought about what I was gonna say for minutes while I was waiting in the line. When finally it was my turn to pay, this is what I said to the cachier girl &#8220;_I lived in New Orleans for years and recently moved to Boston area, one of the things I miss the most from New Orleans is this bakery, thank you very much_&#8220;. She said &#8220;_thanks, you are \*very\* kind_&#8221; with the arrogance I remember from years ago. I smiled. She had no idea why this retard customer was so happy about.

My destination for lunch was another amazing place that was quite affordable: _Liuzza&#8217;s_. Because Liuzza&#8217;s is relatively far from the touristic areas of New Orleans, it is almost a _locals only_ restaurant. I had learned about it after 4 years in New Orleans. It would be a shame if you don&#8217;t go there if you ever end up in New Orleans.

<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/images/three-meals-in-new-orleans-nola-12.jpg" border="0" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

And the only thing you have to eat when you are there is &#8216;_BBQ shrimp_&#8216;.

I am very sorry for including the following photograph, the photograph of the MOST DELICIOUS THING IN THE WORLD, and make you realize what you actually you have been missing in your life. I know, it is not fair:

<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/images/three-meals-in-new-orleans-nola-13.jpg" border="0" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

But if you happen to go to this place, and finally have the opportunity to eat the MOST DELICIOUS THING IN THE WORLD, I want you to be calm, and considerate. I actually want you to think about all the people who live on random parts of this planet who can not find aything to eat, let alone the thing in front of you. And first I want you to realize how lucky you are, almost in embarrassment. Then I want you to take a moment to question &#8216;_why are you so lucky&#8217;,_ and spend some of that moment to also think about who is responsible for your luck, and who is responsible for the suffering of the most. Bon apetit.

When I was leaving Liuzza&#8217;s I saw a sign on the wall that I hadn&#8217;t seen when I walked. It was putting my feelings into words:

  </tr>
</table>

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

The last stop of the day was Balcony Bar on Magazine Street to drink an Abita Amber.

  </tr>
</table>

Amber is a Munich style Lager from the closeby brewery, Abita. It is one of the best things I&#8217;ve ever tasted, and it is one of the things I miss the most.

  </tr>
</table>

I took a big sip, held my beer towards the streets of New Orleans and I quietly murmured:

> Cheers, Anoush.

<p style="text-align: center;">

For an anorexic-wannabe like myself, the day was already full of action with respect to eating and drinking (especially considering the fact that I&#8217;ve been eating once or twice a day lately). But the night hasn&#8217;t ended yet. An old old friend I found in Balcony Bar, Mustafa Yücesoy, took me to a Turkish restaurant called Fatoush. I tried, but couldn&#8217;t stop him. Because Mustafa is a guy who is not playing around. He even drinks his rakı without any water:

<table width="100%" border="0">

    <td align="center">
      <img alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/images/three-meals-in-new-orleans-nola-19.jpg" border="0" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

I&#8217;m not playing around either:

<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/images/three-meals-in-new-orleans-nola-18.jpg" border="0" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

I promise I put only a little bit of water :(

While eating _lahmacun_ and drinking our rakı, Mustafa and I talked about his plans he is hoping to accomplish next year, and the things I managed to fuck-up last year. The conversation was so nice, that at some point I forgot that I was in the US (it is not really surprising actually, thanks to rakı, I almost forgot about who I was too).

Right before my scheduled departure we had breakfast together with Damian, my old friend who hosted me in New Orleans. Then we walked a little bit around [Pontchartrain Lake](http://meren.org/2009/07/lake-pontchartrain/). Damian is such a smart person. Every time we spend time together and talk about things I realize how coarse I am as an intellectual or as an academic. And this time the topic was about the dynamics that shape our personality how how we decide who we are.

Then I said _&#8217;till the next time_, and flew back.

The way back was pretty intense in terms of &#8216;_thinking_&#8216;. The remiander of this post will be about a part of this thinking that is still somewhat complicated for me to discuss. I am going to write about it, simply because I believe writing is one of the best ways to reveal the very fundamental components, or _the essence_ of a complicated and somewhat foggy thought.

OK.

This is actually about something that I started thinking about while we were having all sorts of conversations with Damian, and it is about the _language_ and _one&#8217;s_ _identity_.

As someone who used Turkish for years, and who has been expressing himself in English lately, I am witnessing the impact of the tools that facilitate the communication on one&#8217;s personality.

There is a great difference between Meren who uses Turkish, and Meren who uses English with respect to the things he chooses to talk about, and things he wants to mention. Of course, this great difference comes from the differences he finds between Turkish and English. For instance some things are easier for him to explain in Turkish, meanwhile there are some other things that English is the only way to explain. You may argue &#8220;_Well, Meren learned about himself in Turkish, and he learned science in English_&#8220;. Maybe some of it is as simple as this argument suggests. Although I think there is another aspect which is pretty sophisticated.

I belive that all languages that survived to this day are _Turing complete_, which means that any meaning that can be conveyed in one language can also be conveyed in another one. However, the fact that everything can be described in any language does not imply that everything can be described in any language _easily._ I believe there are major similarities between common spoken languages and computer programming languages with this respect: Even though two different programming languages may be Turing complete, someone may strongly prefer to use one of them to perform a certain task rather than the other. All programming languages were designed with varying degrees of architectural differences to solve different needs, at different times, by different groups of people.

For instance Oğuz Atay, who wrote &#8216;[Tutunamayanlar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutunamayanlar)&#8216; because he grew up with Turkish, could have written something along the lines of Lord of the Rings if he had grown up with English instead (which would have been pretty upsetting). I know there are so many things that affects one&#8217;s journey in life, but Turkish was also an important player in shaping his world view, which resulted in a masterpiece that makes sense only in his native language.

&#8216;_Narrating_&#8216; is actually an active way of learning and understanding. What we tell, forms who we are in a way. Here is why: the very act of telling about something actually forces us to _catch_ abstract thoughts that are raw, that lack structure, and were never translated into any language, and _format_ them using the tools of a commong language to convert them into something that can be transmitted to other people. This _formatting_ process requires one to mingle with the thought in a very intimate and conscious way, as a result of which, the thought itself inherits something from this process (through that curious feedback by the process itself (think about it in the terms of quantum mechanics, which tells you that you actually alter the state of a system by observing it)). This is exactly why telling about something is by no means a passive event.

For instance while I am struggling to write about all the thoughts that are scattered around my mind on this page, I am knitting a coherent narrative (at least I am trying). The more I talk about the subject, the more emerges the pattern, which hopefully conveys what I intend to convey. And the more obvious the pattern becomes, the more picky and selective I become. I start chosing the ones among the thoughts that are raw and scattered _to extend_, or _to complement_ the pattern which was not there before, and which is now almost obvious to me. Now I go back, leave some of the thoughts I picked before thinking that they would be useful, and find other ones to replace them from the chaotic pool of thoughts hidden in the thick forest of neurons in my brain. So I knit something for you. Right here. By just telling you about a particular idea. If I make any sense at all, it is because what I create is not random. If you understand more and more about what I&#8217;m trying to explain, it&#8217;s because there is an emerging pattern. Meanwhile, my thoughts are _learning_ about themselves by simply seeing which part they complement in this big picture. The curious impact of the language 0n it&#8217;s user is entangled to this very feedback. When the concepts and thoughts that someone chose to talk about differ depending on the language they use, the thoughts that learned much about themselves start to show an asymetrical distribution from one language to another.

I believe that there is a profound relationship between one&#8217;s thoughts and their character. Focusing on different clusters of thoughts in different languages introduces different characters within one person.

When you meet this person in one language you miss some of them, when you meet this person in another language, you miss some other part of them.

I am someone on the Internet, which is the only remaining place where I use Turkish, and I am someone else in my daily life, in which I use English most of the time.

I find this phenomenon absolutely fascinating, and somewhat unfair.

Once you accept that the &#8216;_narration_&#8216; is not a passive event, further explorations of this idea starts to offer some hints to answer some essential questions such as &#8220;how do we decide who we are?&#8221; and &#8220;what shapes our personality?&#8221;.

I think _who we are_ is _a searching_ that evolves and finds it&#8217;s way under the selective pressure of the things we _manage to tell_ among all the things we find _worth telling_. So, I think what we tell is as important as how we tell it. Therefore some of who we are must have something to do with the narrative we stuck on. Do an experiment. Listen to people. See what you will find about them in what they choose to tell.

And once you are satisfied with others try to listen to yourself.
