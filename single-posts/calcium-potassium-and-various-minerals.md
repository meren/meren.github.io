Meetings were always too complicated. According to the instructions he got on the phone he parked on the left side of the empty road. His friend was going to be there soon, and they were going to hug each other, and they were going to talk about the old days, and so on. _What if we can&#8217;t find anything to talk about? What if he gets bored?_ Write it down: &#8220;_Life was jammed in between such stressful anticipations_&#8220;.

He left the car thinking that he might see him coming. Started looking around on the side walk. The street was effectively empty. _Why did you put all the side walks if you were not going to walk?_ Totally. _Should I write this down as well?_ No, not this one. Or whatever. We have been writing so much, why stop now.

He went to the pole that was a couple of meters in front of the car and stood up on the bulge at the bottom of it. He was holding the pole with one hand and was slowly turning around. At the end of every full turn, he was looking at her, who was sitting in the car.

It&#8217;s been only days since they&#8217;ve met. But there she was sitting in the car. _There is a trip I planned before I met you, I&#8217;ll visit a very old friend of mine in Washington D.C. and come back, would you like to come with me if there is nothing else you have to do on this weekend?_ Why would she want that? Why do you have to ask for things that&#8230;. _Yes I would_. Oh.

Life is such a sweetheart sometimes.

_2 minutes later._

While turning around the pole steadily, at the corner of his eye he saw the cars door opening. He didn&#8217;t stop. If he were to stop for every door that gets opened he wouldn&#8217;t have been there that day. _I wonder if the pole stains my hand._ _Schrödinger&#8217;s hand. Until you observe, they are both stained and clean_. Quantum breaths to daily stress. He was a poor guy like this. Part of his brain was constantly discontented. What if it gets stained? You&#8217;d wash it and you&#8217;d be fine. He kept turning. While he was somewhere in the middle of his turn he heard the door got closed. _Shrödinger&#8217;s woman. Until I observe, she&#8217;s both in and outside of the car_. For some reason this idea pleased him. _I don&#8217;t think my hand is stained, would that paint still be on the pole if it was so easy to come off&#8230;_ Oh, damn your fucking hand. Live the moment for once. When the car was in his sight again, he saw her, taking calm steps towards the pole. Her hands in her pockets. _Schrödinger&#8217;s woman: outside of the car after all._

__He stopped. He wrapped himself up with the seriousness of a businessman:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; Hi. How may I help you?</em><br /> <em> &#8211; I don&#8217;t know. What are you selling?</em>
</p>

Seriousness on his face turned into a vigilant, shadowy look of a drug dealer. He narrowed his eyes:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; I&#8217;m selling my soul.</em>
</p>

He was selling his soul. Truer words hadn&#8217;t been spoken on that street. She imitated the man who was looking at her from half a meter above. Narrowed her eyes:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; How much do you ask for it?<br /> </em><em>&#8211; The price doesn&#8217;t really matter.</em>
</p>

The price didn&#8217;t really matter. He knew many people don&#8217;t value things when you don&#8217;t ask anything in return, but he wasn&#8217;t willing to set a price yet. He didn&#8217;t really know its value anyway. He was a considerably knowledgable guy, but didn&#8217;t know much about the things that actually mattered.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; Lets have a trial period.</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Hm.</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Ownership can start now, and you can make your payment the way you see fit once you feel you want to keep it. How does it sound?</em><br /> <em> &#8211; It sounds like you&#8217;ve got yourself a deal.</em><br /> <em> &#8211; I mean, if there is a compatibility issue or anything I don&#8217;t want us to deal with reimbur&#8230;</em><br /> <em> &#8211; Sure, sure.</em>
</p>

He didn&#8217;t want to ruin the magic of the moment by saying one more thing. He took his eyes off her and looked towards where the lines converge at the far end of the sidewalk. This time his eyes met his old friend&#8217;s eyes, who was walking towards them smiling. _Life. Is such a. Sweetheart. Sometimes__._ Write it just like this. _Sure._ Don&#8217;t forget the periods so people wouldn&#8217;t mistake it with a cliché told in vain and read it all in one breath. Sometimes it really is like that, and it should be greeted calmly, and modestly.

> People asked me how my weekend was. I had no words to describe. I told them it was OK. Sometimes overwhelming happiness brings overwhelming shame. Feels too heavy to describe precisely.
> 
> I was on the road.
> 
> I met lovely people. New and old.
> 
> 3 nights I went to sleep next to a beautiful person. 3 mornings I woke up next to her.
> 
> Life was complete. I lived that life. And sold my soul.

&nbsp;

> I&#8217;ve read your words over and over.
> 
> I can&#8217;t quite articulate much right now, so forgive me.

_2 weeks later._

While he was looking at the street through the window in his dimly lit living room, focus of his stare was going between the tremulous yellows of fire place reflected on the window, and the feeble branches of naked trees vibrate with the wind. _How long have I been waiting?_ The act of waiting is not a passive, independent thing. There must be a sort of quantum entanglement going on between the one who waits and the one who is being waited for. Particle physics is not there yet, but the universe taught us through the years: when there is someone waiting, even the ones who are planning to arrive early runs late, even the ones who are definitely coming ends up not coming at all. Actually, the more decisively you wait, the more late they arrive, the longer you wait, the more likely they never arrive at all. _How long have I been waiting?_ It felt that he had been waiting for a very long time. It wasn&#8217;t true. So there still was hope. He remembered the nights his mom&#8217;s been waiting for his dad. _Once they get older, men become their moms, sir_. There is nothing left they haven&#8217;t had become once they are older, kiddo.

He focused on the yellows of the fire place on the window. The winter view outside got blurry. _Patterns, patterns_. The exothermic reaction he started in the fireplace was consuming the woods. While the carbon-rich molecules were being broken down to upgrade themselves to simpler forms of existence, the heat was being emerged and getting all the attention. Equally devoted heroes of the journey of the wood, on the other hand, namely calcium, potassium and various minerals, were being accumulated at the bottom of the fire place very quietly. Foreign thoughts appeared in his mind while he stared at the reflection of the fire. They seemed to possess answers for very important questions. They were just about to play their piece, but they went back to where they came from as her truck slowed down in front of the house.

Meetings were always too complicated. _What if she sees me in front of the window? What if she asks herself whether I had nothing to do but her? _Write it down, kiddo: &#8220;_Life was jammed in between such stressful anticipations_&#8220;. _We have this already written, sir._ Well, good for us. He sat on the couch with panic. Took his computer on his lap. _Computer world_. Changed his mind. Stood up. Again, in panic. Looked through the window. She is parking. He went out. She was closing her door. They walked towards each other. Once they were close enough she offered the red brick she held:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8211; The payment.</em>
