Four years ago probably no one would have expected New Orleans Saints to play final in NFL any time soon, especially after what Hurricane Katrina did to New Orleans&#8230; But they did.

The theme of the Super Bowl started to affect life in New Orleans weeks before the game. I was interested in the reaction of people and the city much more than the game itself. As soon as the game started, I took my camera and went to French Quarter to document this major event.
