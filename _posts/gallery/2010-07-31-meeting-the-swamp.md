The only conception about swamps I had was coming from &#8220;[Down by Law](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090967/)&#8220;, Jim Jarmusch&#8217;s amazing movie, since we don&#8217;t have any swamps back in Turkey. It took me more than 3 years to really understand and appreciate this fragile and beautiful landscape. One day, in Jean Lafitte National Park in Louisiana, I figured that there would be more to the swamp than I had envisioned and decided to document my journey of getting acquainted with it.
