A horizontal, leaderless, aimless gathering of the people. Absolutely phenomenal. Some people despise Occupy Wall Street due to the fact that they have no mainstream purpose and/or political stand; I believe they miss the entire point.

I don&#8217;t think it would be fair to expect everyone to wrap their minds around it, but whatever is happening today to the peoples of the world, is happening mainly because of the decisions that were made by people who did haveÂ mainstream purposes and obvious political stands.

Perhaps it is time to stop and think what really needs to be done. This is exactly what is happening nowadays at Zuccotti Park, New York. It might be a failure at the end, but it is definitely an important quest and an important milestone.
